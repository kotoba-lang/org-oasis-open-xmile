(ns xmile.validate
  "Structural validation for xmile.model models, returning
  kotoba.dsl.problem-shaped problems (:xmile/severity :error|:warn).

  :error means the model is not valid XMILE (dangling reference, illegal
  algebraic loop, malformed sim_specs/gf, a malformed DELAY1/DELAY3/SMTH1/
  SMTH3/TREND call, ...). :warn means the model IS valid XMILE but
  exercises a feature xmile.execute v1 does not yet simulate (arrays,
  conveyor/queue transport, DELAY/DELAYN/SMTHN/FORCST, stochastic
  functions, integration methods other than euler/rk4) -- see README
  Follow-ups. A model with only :warn problems is spec-valid but
  xmile.execute/run will throw if you actually try to run it.

  DELAY1/DELAY3/SMTH1/SMTH3/TREND (xmile.expr/hidden-stock-builtins) are
  IMPLEMENTED (xmile.execute/desugar-delays), so a call to one of them is
  no longer flagged as :xmile/unsupported-builtin -- instead
  `delay-smooth-problems` below checks it's a structurally usable call
  (right argument count; a positive delay/smoothing/averaging-time where
  that argument is a literal constant)."
