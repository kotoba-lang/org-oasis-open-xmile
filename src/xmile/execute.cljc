;; --- sec 3.5.3 DELAY1/DELAY3/SMTH1/SMTH3/TREND, via hidden-stock desugaring ---
;;
;; The OASIS XMILE v1.0 spec HTML text for sec 3.5.3 gives argument lists
;; and default-initial-value semantics for these built-ins but -- verified
;; by fetching the actual spec text -- no explicit differential equation;
;; real tools (Stella, Vensim) all implement them as hidden stocks
;; internally. The exact construction below is verified against the Vensim
;; Reference Manual's "equivalent equations" for each function:
;;   DELAY1 / DELAY1I  -- https://vensim.com/documentation/fn_delay1.html
;;     LV = INTEG(input - DELAY1, initial*delay_time), DELAY1 = LV/delay_time
;;   DELAY3 / DELAY3I  -- https://www.vensim.com/documentation/fn_delay3.html
;;     3 stages of the DELAY1 shape chained, each with delay_time/3, all 3
;;     stages sharing the SAME initial condition (steady-state consistent).
;;   SMOOTH3 / SMOOTH3I (XMILE's SMTH3) --
;;     https://vensim.com/documentation/fn_smooth3.html -- same 3-stage
;;     construction as DELAY3 but directly in output units (no LV/delay_time
;;     rescaling needed).
;;   TREND -- https://vensim.com/documentation/fn_trend.html
;;     avval = INTEG((input-avval)/average_time, input/(1+ini*average_time))
;;     TREND = (input-avval)/(average_time*avval)
;;
;; Vensim's DELAY1/DELAY3 track a material-in-transit level LV = H*delay_time
;; (so LV's own INTEG is in "amount-in-the-pipe" units, useful for materal
;; conveyance); H below is that same LV rescaled by delay_time, i.e.
;; H = LV/delay_time, directly in the output's own units. Since
;; d(LV)/dt = input - DELAY1 = input - H and H = LV/delay_time,
;; d(H)/dt = (1/delay_time) d(LV)/dt = (input-H)/delay_time -- algebraically
;; identical dynamics to Vensim's, just carried directly in output units
;; (simpler here since xmile.execute only ever needs the ratio H, never LV
;; itself). SMTH1's hidden stock is that exact same construction (SMTH1 and
;; DELAY1 are structurally identical -- only the conventional SD-modeling
;; use/naming differs, not the math): dH/dt = (input-H)/smoothing_time.
;;
;; DELAY3/SMTH3's 3 stages all sharing ONE shared initial condition (rather
;; than e.g. stages 2/3 starting at 0) is exactly Vensim's own construction
;; (LV1/LV2's initial conditions are literally "= LV3" in the Vensim
;; equations, i.e. all 3 stages start at the same value as the overall
;; initial/DELAY3 value) -- this is what makes the whole chain already in
;; steady state at t=start if `input` has been at its initial value forever
;; before the simulation starts, rather than showing a spurious startup
;; transient.
;;
;; TREND's default `initial-trend` is 0 per spec (sec 3.5.3); its hidden
;; smoothed-level stock's initial value is solved BACKWARDS from that
;; initial trend and input(t=start) via Vensim's own formula above, so that
;; evaluating the TREND expression at t=start reproduces the given
;; initial-trend exactly (verified algebraically: Level0*(1+g*T) = input0 =>
;; (input0-Level0)/(T*Level0) = g).

  "Rewrite `model` so every sec 3.5.3 DELAY1/DELAY3/SMTH1/SMTH3/TREND call
  anywhere in ANY variable's equation (however deeply nested) is replaced
  by a reference to one or more freshly-added HIDDEN stock/flow/aux
  variables that implement it (see the big comment above this function for
  the exact construction + spec/Vensim citations). Returns
  `{:xmile/model model' :xmile/hidden-names #{...}}`: `model'` is a new
  model value with the hidden variables added and every variable's
  `:xmile/eqn` replaced by its (possibly-unchanged) rewritten expr TREE --
  the input `model` itself is not mutated (plain Clojure data). Called once,
  up front, by `run`; `hidden-names` lets `run` exclude the synthetic
  variables from the public `:xmile/series` it returns.

  Only the CALL SITE's textual/tree shape changes -- the original model's
  own variables keep their own names and kind; only brand-new synthetic
  names (`__delay1_<n>`, `__delay3_<n>_1/_2/_3`, `__smth1_<n>`,
  `__smth3_<n>_1/_2/_3`, `__trend_<n>` + `__trend_<n>_level`, plus each
  hidden stock's own driving flow named `<stock>_flow`) are added. Throws
  (rather than silently colliding) if a generated hidden name somehow
  already names a variable in `model` -- vanishingly unlikely given the
  `__`-prefixed convention, but checked defensively.

  DELAY1(input, delay-time[, initial]) / SMTH1(input, smoothing-time[, initial]):
  H(0) = initial or, if omitted, `input` evaluated at t=start; dH/dt =
  (input-H)/time; the call site becomes a :ref to H.
  DELAY3/SMTH3: as above but 3 stages in series, each with time/3, all 3
  sharing the same initial condition; the call site becomes a :ref to the
  3rd (last) stage.
  TREND(input, average-time[, initial-trend]): a hidden Level stock per
  the Vensim formula above; the call site becomes a :ref to a hidden AUX
  computing (input-Level)/(average-time*Level) each step, ZIDZ-guarded
  (0.0 if the denominator is exactly 0, matching Vensim's own
  `TREND=ZIDZ(input-avval,average_time*ABS(avval))`) -- Level legitimately
  starts at/near 0 whenever `input` itself starts at 0 (a common case, e.g.
  TREND of a STEP/RAMP test input), and JVM Clojure's `/` throws
  ArithmeticException on an exact-zero divisor rather than producing
  IEEE-754 Infinity/NaN (verified directly: `clojure.lang.Numbers/divide`
  special-cases isZero before dividing) -- without the guard this would
  crash, not just numerically misbehave. Away from an EXACT zero
  denominator, no epsilon-guard is applied (same as Vensim's own
  documented caveat: TREND only makes sense for inputs that stay
  meaningfully away from zero -- near-zero, not exactly-zero, denominators
  can still legitimately blow up to a very large value).

  A DELAY1/etc.'s default (omitted) `initial`/`initial-trend` is resolved by
  evaluating its `input` (or the TREND initial-value formula) at t=start via
  the SAME restricted stock-only-dependency pass `xmile.execute/initial-stocks`
  already uses for every ordinary stock's own initial-value equation (sec
  3.1.1) -- i.e. it must reduce to other stocks/constants/TIME/DT-based test
  inputs (PULSE/STEP/RAMP), not to a :flow/:aux. If it doesn't,
  `initial-stocks` throws the same `xmile.expr: unknown identifier` an
  ordinary stock referencing a flow/aux in ITS OWN initial-value equation
  would already throw (a pre-existing v1 limitation, not one introduced
  here) -- supply an explicit `initial`/`initial-trend` argument in that
  case."
