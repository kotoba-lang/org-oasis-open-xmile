(ns xmile.kotoba-simulation-parity-test
  "Parity gate for the STEP: `xmile.execute` against the Kotoba simulation core
  in `kotoba/xmile_expr_core.kotoba`.

  The two sibling gates cover the equation language -- the scalar operations,
  then the walk over an expression tree. This one covers what a simulator does
  with them: evaluate the non-stock variables in dependency order (clamping
  each), take a stock's inflows minus its outflows, and advance by Euler or
  classical RK4.

  HOW IT IS CHECKED. Not step-by-step against a private function, and not
  against numbers written down here. `run-through-the-port` below is
  `xmile.execute/run`'s own loop with its four numeric operations replaced by
  the port, and the assertion is that the whole trajectory comes out the same
  as `xmile.execute/run` -- every recorded variable, at every recorded time.
  A model simulated for 40 steps compares 40 rows, so a defect in the step
  arithmetic cannot hide in a single row.

  EXACT, FOR MOST OF IT. Models whose equations contain no transcendental are
  compared with `=`, not a tolerance -- including the RK4 ones. That is only
  possible because the port keeps the .cljc's floating-point association order
  (`y + (dt/6)((k1 + 2k2) + 2k3 + k4)` built from four `scale-add`s), and it is
  the strongest statement available here: 40 steps of RK4 over a stiff-ish
  system agreeing bit-for-bit is not something a nearly-right implementation
  does.

  WHAT IS NOT PORTED, and so is used from `xmile.execute` here rather than
  reimplemented: `desugar-delays`, `topo-order`, `constant-names`,
  `constant-env`, `initial-stocks`, and the time loop and series accumulation.
  Deriving the evaluation order is a graph colouring over the model that also
  proves there is no algebraic loop -- a different kind of claim from anything
  the port makes, and deliberately still `.cljc`."
