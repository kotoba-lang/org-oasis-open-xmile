(ns xmile.kotoba-expr-core-parity-test
  "Parity gate between `xmile.expr` -- the authority, unchanged -- and its
  Kotoba decision core, `kotoba/xmile_expr_core.kotoba`.

  The port is compiled here and executed through the KIR interpreter in this
  same JVM, so no value crosses a runtime boundary: an f64 parameter is an
  ordinary Clojure double going in and coming back out.

  WHAT IS COMPARED. Not `Math/exp` against `f64-exp-bounded` -- that would be
  a test of two kernels. Every case below drives the REAL evaluator, through
  `xmile.expr/eval-expr` on the expr tree the parser would have produced, and
  asserts the port reproduces the number that evaluator returns.

  EXACT vs TOLERANT. The two halves of this gate are deliberately different
  and must not be merged:

    exact    floor INT MOD MIN MAX ABS SQRT, all six relational operators, the
             three logical ones, PI, INF, STEP, RAMP, PULSE. These are IEEE
             operations or selections on both sides; a difference of one ulp
             here is a defect, not rounding.

    tolerant EXP LN LOG10 SIN COS TAN ARCSIN ARCCOS ARCTAN and `^`. The
             .cljc calls the host math library; the port evaluates fixed
             polynomial kernels (amu docs/adr/0009, 0012) that import no host
             transcendental. Bit equality is therefore not available and
             claiming it would be a lie. The bound asserted is `tolerance`
             below; the max error actually observed is printed on every run,
             so drift toward the bound is visible before it crosses.

  DOMAINS. `stated-domain-differences` pins the places the port is NARROWER
  than the host on purpose: it traps where the host would hand back NaN or an
  infinity. That direction is checked too -- a gate that only ever shows
  agreement has not shown that it can disagree."
