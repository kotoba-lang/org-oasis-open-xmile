(ns xmile.kotoba-eval-expr-parity-test
  "Parity gate for the WALK: `xmile.expr/eval-expr` against the Kotoba
  evaluator in `kotoba/xmile_expr_core.kotoba`.

  The sibling gate (`kotoba-expr-core-parity-test`) covers the scalar
  operations one at a time. This one covers the recursive value they hang off:
  every case here starts from an equation STRING, runs the real
  `xmile.expr/parse` over it, and evaluates the resulting tree twice -- once
  through `xmile.expr/eval-expr`, once through the port. Nothing in this file
  hand-builds a tree, so the trees under test are exactly the ones the parser
  produces.

  WHAT MAKES THIS MORE THAN THE SCALAR GATE. Three properties only appear once
  there is a tree:

    laziness      `IF` evaluates one branch; `and`/`or` short-circuit. An
                  eager port passes every arithmetic case and still fails
                  `IF 1 THEN 2 ELSE Missing`.
    refusal order `xmile.expr` rejects DELAY1/RANDOM BEFORE evaluating their
                  arguments, so `DELAY1(Missing, 5)` reports DELAY1 and not
                  the unbound identifier.
    failure       the .cljc throws and the port returns `[:result :f64
                  :string]`. Both directions are compared: same number when
                  it succeeds, both failing when it does not, and the port's
                  message classified against the .cljc's.

  EXACT vs TOLERANT is inherited from the scalar gate and for the same reason:
  an equation with no transcendental in it must agree bit-for-bit."
