;; The portable suite on nbb — no build step, no JVM.
;;
;; These five namespaces and the sources under them are `.cljc`, and until
;; this file existed `clojure -M:test` was the only thing that ever ran
;; them, so a defect in the ClojureScript half of a `.cljc` was invisible
;; here (ADR-2608190100).
;;
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:$(clojure -Spath -M:test)" test/run_portable.cljs
;;
;; This is a SUBSET of `clojure -M:test`, deliberately, and the difference is
;; three `.clj` namespaces no ClojureScript runner can list:
;;
;;   xmile.kotoba-eval-expr-parity-test
;;   xmile.kotoba-expr-core-parity-test
;;   xmile.kotoba-simulation-parity-test
;;
;; Each drives the Kotoba compiler and its KIR interpreter, which are JVM
;; libraries; they check `.kotoba` decision cores against these Clojure
;; implementations and cannot themselves run on ClojureScript. So the two
;; numbers are 62 here and 89 on the JVM, and that gap is the parity suite
;; rather than anything dropped from this one.
;;
;; `xmile.xml/parse-string` is the file-content boundary and is `:clj`-only
;; (javax.xml). `xmile.xml-test` covers the portable `parse-doc`/`emit-doc`
;; tree boundary on both runtimes; the reader-conditional string path stays
;; on the JVM.
;;
;; Every deftest-bearing portable namespace is named BOTH in the require and
;; in the `run-tests` call: requiring registers the vars, only `run-tests`
;; runs them, and a runner naming a subset prints the same `Ran N tests`
;; shape as one naming all of them.
